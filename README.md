## 🧐 What is inside?

​

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/public`**: This directory contains immages and fonts that use in the project.

3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

4.  **`.env.`**: These files used to store sensitive information such as credentials for your app. Information typically should not be seen by the end-user i.e database logic credentials, API keys, API endpoints etc.

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`deploy.sh`** This file is a universal deployment script that makes it easy for you to deploy your code, files, configuration etc. to multiple server via ssh.

8.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
10. **`tsconfig.json`**: The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

11. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
